    heading: "Energy Efficiency and Fuel Switching",
    desc: "There is a multitude of projects that focus on the welfare of rural households. They do this by making smoke-free biogas cookstoves and advanced biogas digesters available, which are installed and maintained by local technicians. The aim is to reduce emissions by traditional means like coal and firewood and provide families with clean and free biogas for energy needs in cooking and lighting.",

    heading: "Blue Carbon",
    desc: "Apart from trees, oceans and coastlines are also an important part of the natural carbon cycle. Mangroves, sea grasses, and salt marshes along the coast act as carbon sinks and hold carbon. Blue carbon projects aim to create more carbon sinks by investing in mangrove planting and other initiatives.",
