It is estimated that between 2 tons per day (TPD) (2000kgs/d) of agricutural waste is generated at the project site between the years 2014-2016 and 6 TPD (6000kg/d) daily between 2017-2020. The APMC is an autonomous body. There are several agricultural produce market committees (APMCs) established in each state to facilitate marketing of the agricultural produce. The facility and its waste management is outside the perview of the local municipal authority and hence there is no monetary assistance provided by the state government for the waste handling at the market located on the national highway. By using the biogas captured from the digesters the project activity generates power for captive use. The project activity is the controlled biological treatment of biomass or other organic matters through anaerobic digestion in closed reactors equipped with biogas recovery for electricity generation and a combustion/flaring system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The sludge is then dried and wastewater is reused and recycled back into the biogas process. The dried sludge is then converted to organic fertilizer that is sold locally to farmers at low cost by the project proponents. The APMC at Vadodara has established itself as a centre of excellence in catering to the need of farmers by promoting three market yards &ndash; Sayajipura, Hathikhana and Kewdabaug. Other features of the yard are wide approach road, private telephone exchange, 100-tonne ripening chamber for banana, mango and papaya, organic waste converter, an information system to address issues relating to farmers and&nbsp;soil health laboratory. Today, an estimated one-third of all the food produced in the world goes to waste. That&rsquo;s equal to about 1.3 billion tons of fruits, vegetables, meat, dairy, seafood, and grains that either never leave the farm, get lost or spoiled during distribution, or are thrown away in hotels, grocery stores, restaurants, schools, or home kitchens. It could be enough calories to feed every undernourished person on the planet. When organic waste such as fruits and vegetables in the project activity goes to waste, we also waste all the energy and water it takes to grow, harvest, transport, and package it. And when such biomass goes to the landfill and rots, it produces methane&mdash;a greenhouse gas even more potent than carbon dioxide. About 6%-8% of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced if we stop wasting food and such organic waste. Decomposing organic material in anaerobic conditions &mdash; by microbes in the absence of oxygen &mdash; releases methane into the atmosphere. Anaerobic fermentation is common in landfill and open stockpiles such as manure piles. Global emissions from waste have almost doubled since 1970 and now produce 3% of anthropogenic (human origin) emissions (IPCC 2014). About half of these emissions come from the anaerobic fermentation of solid waste disposal on land.</p>\r\n",

Burning biomass contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation and air pollution, adversely affecting the climate and people&rsquo;s health. In India, more than a million people die every year from inhaling harmful fumes from cooking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Since 2009, FairClimateFund has been working with its local partner ADATS to supply biogas installations to 12,000 farming families in the Chickballapur district of Karnataka province. Organic waste (mainly cow dung) is converted in an underground bio-digester into methane gas for cooking. About 2 cows are needed to provide an average household with sufficient gas for cooking on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Cooking with biogas is clean, there is no release of harmful smoke. This means health benefits for the whole family, in particular for women and children. In addition, women no longer have to fetch wood, cooking is easier and faster, and it prevents black soot deposits in the house. On average, women save eight hours a week by using biogas. This time can be spent on family, household or economic activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Moreover, the bio slurry is a very good and free alternative to fertilizers., helping to improve agricultural productivity.</p>\r\n",

However, the smoke produced by this method of cooking has serious health implications. This carbon offset project aims to counteract this problem: By granting microcredits, consumers are enabled to purchase efficient cookstoves and solar lights. Families buy the products locally at market price - a best practice from the microfinance sector, as giving products away for free would hit the local economy and lower the value of the products. Buying the products locally strengthens small businesses, with the project additionally supporting suppliers with training and start-up capital. And the climate benefits: Using the efficient products saves an average of 100,000 tonnes of CO2 per year.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"background:transparent\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"orphans:2\"><span style=\"widows:2\"><b>How does climate action with social impact projects work?</b></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"background:transparent\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"orphans:2\"><span style=\"widows:2\">Social impact project includes one or more technologies that create direct social added value in addition to climate action. It involved the distribution of efficient cooking stoves, solar lights, or drinking water purification: Efficient cooking stoves make better use of the energy supplied and reduce the smoke produced when cooking over an open fire. A similar problem exists when households do not have access to clean drinking water, as the water must be boiled over an open fire first before it can be used without hesitation. Remedies include the provision of drinking water treatment aids, such as filters, or access to groundwater from wells. In addition, solar lights help to illuminate the rooms and replace expensive kerosene lamps, which are a frequent cause of fire accidents.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n",
